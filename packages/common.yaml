# These are common configs that I use in every board, no matter what the
# model or architecture.
# You need to refer to this package before the board specific packages
# so they can override stuff here (for example disabling uart in logger)

# The ESPHome native API is used to communicate with clients directly, with
# a highly-optimized network protocol. Currently, only the ESPHome tool,
# Home Assistant and ioBroker use this native API.
# Therefore, it is not enabled by default, you can always enable it in each
# main configuration file.
# BEWARE: if you enable this and don't set reboot_timeout to '0s', the
# device will reboot each 15min if there are no clients (i.e. HomeAssistant)
# connected to the api. On the other hand, if you do intend to make use of it,
# then leave reboot_timeout at default value because it can help recovering
# from situations where esphome thinks wifi is ok but it is not and no clients
# can connect to it (this is a documented issue).
# You probably do not need this "api:" feature if you are using MQTT instead
# (they are rearely used together).

#  reboot_timeout: 0s
