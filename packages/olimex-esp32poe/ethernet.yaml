# The reason for this definition to be separate from the base definitions
# is that you may not want ethernet in favor of wifi, so you can include
# it separately.

# This is the ethernet definitions for this board. It CANNOT be used
# at the same time as wifi, so if you include this file, make sure
# you don't include any wifi config.
#
# Information about ethernet is always included as a standard, you
# can remove/delete it from your main config if you prefer.
