# Hardware:
# - Olimex ESP32-POE, MCU: ESP-32, w/ ethernet port
#
# Board info: https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-POE/open-source-hardware
#
# This board have all GPIOs exposed in headers on the board, so the documentation
# above should be sufficient to understand it
#
# It does not have any peripheral except a button (two buttons actually
# but the other one is hardware reset). Not even a LED (only the power and the TX/RX
# ones, but those are not controllable). It does have Bluetooth.

# In this board, the useable button is NOT connected to GPIO0 as in most other boards
# Therefore it is a normal button (in fact it is called But1 and not FLASH) on GPI34.
# GPIO0 is still used as part of the boot process and needs to be pulled down, but it
# is connected only to the Flow Control Pins of the serial chip so the board will
# reset and enter programming mode automatically every time you try to upload.
# GPIO34 is INPUT only so it is called GPI34. It has no impact on booting.
